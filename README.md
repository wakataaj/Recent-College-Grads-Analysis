# Recent-College-Grads-Analysis

- The data in this project is a collection of student majors, and various pieces of information about that major, most notably the number of stduents in them as a total and by gender as well as what category that major was in, as well as the media income for that major, unemployment rate, among many other attributes.

- This is a simple data exploration project I completed in conjunction with the Dataquest.io curriculum, in the future I will be adding to this project in order to better my skills and find more interesting insights into this dataset.

- Credit to fivethirty eight for their plethora of datasets, I will be using them a ton to practice on, here is the link to their Github repository: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data
